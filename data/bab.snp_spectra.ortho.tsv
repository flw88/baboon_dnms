# Compiled from doi:10.1101/gr.247122.118
# Includes SNPs from 86 baboons (not including the pedigrees 
# in the study) that are at low allelic frequency in the sample 
# (i.e., non-singleton, < 2% AF) and in orthologous regions
# of the genome. Ancestral allele inferred from rhesus macaque
# multialignment (rheMac2).
